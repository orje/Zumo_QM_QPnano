# Zumo_QM_QPnano
This is a project to /learn/find out, how to program the Pololu Zumo with the QM/QPnano framework. It's an project for me in every way. That's the reason, why I put everything, that I think and try, into the respository. I will sort and clean it up from time to time.  
I share everthing on GitHub for others to learn, get inspired or advice me.  
Because of the fact, that I'm still a freetime beginner in the embedded world and the C language, I have to go step by step, trying to adapt the examples from the QM/QP framework for the ATmega328P to the ATmega32U4.  
First I tried to adapt the blinky example. And because the framework needs a timer to generate a timetick, I adapted the timer/counter 4 for that. This timer is only used in the buzzer library of the Zumo.
